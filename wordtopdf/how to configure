##Step 1: Create a new batch file (e.g., doc2pdf.bat)<br>
Save this to a folder included in your system PATH (explained below):<br>

@echo off
setlocal

if "%~1"=="" (
    echo Usage: doc2pdf "full\path\to\file.docx"
    exit /b 1
)

:: Input file
set "infile=%~1"

:: Check if file exists
if not exist "%infile%" (
    echo File not found: %infile%
    exit /b 1
)

:: Extract output path (same name, but .pdf extension)
for %%F in ("%infile%") do (
    set "outfile=%%~dpnF.pdf"
)

echo Converting "%infile%" to "%outfile%"...
officetopdf.exe "%infile%" "%outfile%"
echo Done.

endlocal

##  Step 2: Add it to your PATH<br>
1. Save doc2pdf.bat in a folder like:<br>

C:\Tools\Scripts\<br>

2. Add that folder to your system PATH:<br>

Press Win + R → type sysdm.cpl<br>

Go to Advanced → Environment Variables<br>

Edit the Path variable under System variables<br>

Add: C:\Tools\Scripts\<br>

## From WSL, you can invoke the Windows .exe directly like this:

officetopdf.exe quiz.docx quiz.pdf

This works if the .exe is in your Windows PATH.
