1. Open Windows PowerShell as Run as Administrator.

2. Run the command:
   wsl -d Ubuntu -u root

3. Kill all processes associated with the old username (e.g., nadirabbasitu):
   pkill -u nadirabbasitu

4. Verify if the processes have ended:
   ps -u nadirabbasitu
   - If processes are still running, kill them using:
     kill -9 <process_id>   # Example: kill -9 366
   - Verify again with:
     ps -u nadirabbasitu

5. Rename the user:
   usermod -l nadir nadirabbasitu

6. Update the home directory:
   usermod -d /home/nadir -m nadir

7. Rename the group (if applicable):
   groupmod -n nadir nadirabbasitu

8. Finally, set the new user as the default login user:
   wsl -d Ubuntu --set-default-user nadir

Steps to change the password for an existing user:

1. Open PowerShell as Run as Administrator.
2. Run:
   wsl -u root
3. Change the password:
